This project is based on the work of elanthis (project gamepad).
The programms and makefile are based on his and the libary is from him. We only modified the makefile and added our own programms.

How to get it to work (For those who are not blessed with wisdom)
apt-get install libudev-dev
apt-get install libncurses-dev
make

Have Fun
